This BIOS, based on Beta 2.20 (2018/4/13), has been modded to get full NVME support on Asrock Z77 Pro 3 Motherboards.

|||IMPORTANT|||
This bios is only necesary if you want to use an NVME disc as a bootable disc. Not necessary if you want to use it as a secondary drive.

The BIOS has been tested and works perfectly.
